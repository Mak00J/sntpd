.SH NAME
ntpclient \- client to get time from NTP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntpclient [-h hostname] [-c count] [-d] [-f frequency] [-g goodness]
.in 17
.B           [-i interval] [-l] [-n] [-p port] [-r] [-s] [-v] hostname
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntpclient
is an NTP (RFC-1305) client for UNIX-alike computers.  Its functionality is a
small subset of xntpd, but has the potential to function better within that
limited scope.  Since it is much smaller than xntpd, it is also more relevant
for embedded computers.
.PP
If run as root the program daemonizes itself by default and starts synchronizing
with the given NTP server using default settins.  When run as a regular user the
program produces output similar to this:
.sp
.nf
 Day   Second     Elapsed    Stall     Skew  Dispersion  Freq
36765 00180.386    1398.0     40.3  953773.9    793.5  -1240000
36765 00780.382    1358.0     41.3  954329.0    915.5  -1240000
36765 01380.381    1439.0     56.0  954871.3    915.5  -1240000
.fi
.sp
The columns have the following meaning:
.nf
Day, Second: time of measurement, UTC, relative to NTP epoch (Jan 1, 1900)
Elapsed:     total time from query to response (microseconds)
Stall:       time the server reports that it sat on the request (microseconds)
Skew:        difference between local time and server time (microseconds)
Dispersion:  reported by server, see RFC-1305 (microseconds)
Freq:        local clock frequency adjustment (Linux only, ppm*65536)
.fi
.SS "Options"
.TP
.BI  -h " hostname"
NTP server, against which to measure system time.  Can also be supplied
without the -h switch.  This is a
.B mandatory
argument.
.TP
.BI -c " count"
top after count time measurements (default 0 means go forever)
.TP
.B  -d
.br
print diagnostics (feature can be disabled at compile time)
.TP
.BI  -g " goodness"
causes ntpclient to stop after getting a result more accurate
than goodness (microseconds, default 0 means go forever)
.TP
.BI  -i " interval"
check time every interval seconds (default 600)
.TP
.BI -p " port"
local NTP client UDP port (default 0 means "any available")
.TP
.BI  -q " min_delay"
minimum packet delay for transaction (default 800 microseconds)
.TP
.B  -r
.br
replay analysis code based on stdin (feature can be disabled at compile time)
.TP
.BI -f " frequency"
.br
initialize the frequency offset (Linux only, requires root access)
.TP
.B -s
.br
simple clock set (implies -c 1)
(requires root access)
.TP
.B  -l
.br
attempt to lock local clock to server using
.BR adjtimex (1)
(requires root access)
.TP
.B -n
.br
Don't fork.  Prevents ntpclient from daemonizing.
.TP
.B -t
.br
trust network and server, no RFC-4330 recommended cross-checks
.TP
.B -v
.br
Be verbose.  This option will cause time sync events, and version
information at start/stop to be logged.
